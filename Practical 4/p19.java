having parameters for length and breadth is used to initialize length and breadth of the rectangle. 
Let class 'Square' inherit the 'Rectangle' class with its constructor having a parameter for its side 
(suppose s) calling the constructor of its parent class as 'super(s,s)'. Print the area and perimeter
